Rectangle-Mover
===============

Rectangle Mover allows the user to move a rectangle and see a stylized Hello World screen by tapping the rectangle.

## Why "Good Angles?"
I noticed that I actually implemented the angling and movement of the rectangle slightly differently than the app whose movement was being mimic'd, Tinder. However, looking at both of them, I consider this way superior on the grounds that it is more intuitive. The points by which it differs are:

1. Touch keeps the rectangle under the finger.
2. Vertical movement moves the center (and affects angle) rather than simply moves the rectangle along the hypotenuse of it's triangle.

These difference may have been deliberately made by the Tinder people, however, so it's entirely possible that even though I think this feels more natural, their way of doing things is actually the "best" way (possibly supported by user testing and feedback, which I did not have much available in the way of).
